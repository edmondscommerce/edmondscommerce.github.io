<p>Many organisations choose to outsource some or all of their SEO efforts. SEO is at once simple and also complicated. The basic principles are simple enough, but if you do things slightly wrong then you may inadvertantly do something which is actually counter productive to your SEO efforts.</p>

<p>To combat spammy sites, search engines use various methods to check if a site is spammy or not. Unfortunately like any automated system there will always be false positives. What this means to you is that if you accidently do something which the search engines will regard as spammy, you might actually harm rather than help your search engine performance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are many organisations who market themselves as SEO professionals and offer SEO services, but will at best do you no good and at worst could actually trigger your site to be labelled as spammy by the search engines and get you penalised.</p>

<p>Today I received a well written email from a UK based company (I won&rsquo;t name names) offering a link building service with a free 30 day trial. Why not is the first instinct &ndash; a free trial is worth having I suppose.</p>

<p>Upon ringing the company and speaking to one of their represenatives, I quickly determined that this company is not one that I would like to be handling any aspect of my SEO efforts. Here are the things that got me worried:</p>

<p><strong>Searching Google for the company name did not bring them up</strong>
If nothing else, every web site should rank number one for its own name. I asked them about this and they told me that they do not want to rank in the search engines&hellip;? An SEO company that doesn&rsquo;t want to rank in the search engines&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>Their website has a pagerank of 0 &ndash; a white bar in the Google Toolbar</strong>
Many people will tell you these days that pagerank is not important. In general I agree, however having no pagerank at all is a particularly bad sign, especially considering the fact that link building is intended to build link popularity which is pretty much what pagerank is about. For a link building company that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>

<p><strong>They were unwilling to offer any examples of sites that they have done SEO for</strong>
They quoted privacy for this which is fair enough, however I am sure that a happy client would not have any complaints if their site was used to demonstrate the value of the SEO companies services.</p>

<p><strong>They only place links on their own network of sites</strong>
This is where it starts to get really bad. The technique they use is widely acknowledged to be a spamming tactic which Google can detect and will penalise. Getting your link spread across this link farm will almost certainly get your site penalised.</p>

<p>A real link building company would search out sites that are &ldquo;out there&rdquo; on the internet that are in the same niche as your site and will try to get these sites to link back to your site. It&rsquo;s an incredibly difficult and laborious task which is why so many people outsource it.</p>

<p>I have looked into loads of different companies that offer a link building service and have yet to find one that actually does what it says on the tin. I have seen companies that simply add your link to a bunch of link farms that they control (as in this case) which is at best totally useless.</p>

<p>I have also seen companies who charge high monthly rates for links on an ongoing basis. All these guys are doing is simply renting links for you. This is another tactic which Google is going after in a big way. The value of hired links is now questionable. There is no real need to use a middle man for this service as there are plenty of link renting sites set up that you can organise your own link rentals should you decide to go down this path.</p>

<p>In my opinion any SEO tactic that requires ongoing payment to sustain is not real SEO. To me real SEO is like building a wall. Every action you do is another brick in the wall. Your wall gets bigger and stronger every day and with consistent effort you have built a nice solid house that brings consistent traffic with no ongoing investment.</p>

<p>To get the highest possible level of server security and to protect yourself from things like XSS attacks, Edmonds Commerce highly recommend you get mod_security set up on your server.</p>

<p>If you ask your hosts they should be able to do this for you.</p>

<p>You can read all about mod_security <a href="http://www.modsecurity.org/">here</a>. If you would like any help getting mod_security set up on your server then simply get in touch.</p>

<p>One thing we always recommend doing to the standard mod_security configuration is to increase the maximum body size. This restriction by default limits the size of any web page to 500k.</p>

<p>For front end pages, there should never be a time when you need to display a page bigger than this size, however for some administration side systems, it is necessary to create very big pages. This mod_security limit will prevent these pages from being viewable.</p>

<p>To remedy this, you need to edit the file located in the modsecurity.d sub folder of your httpd folder (usually /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/)</p>

<p>In this folder there is a collection of files which handle all of the various security rules that detect potential security threats. There is also a file called modsecurity_crs_10_config.conf.</p>

<p>Edit this file using vi and change the value for the SecResponseBodyLimit setting. We usually recommend upping this to 2mb from the standard .5mb. This means that the server is protected from doing really big things (for example a mysql dump) but is able to display really big admin side HTML pages.</p>

<p>To set it to 2mb you need to change the value of SecResponseBodyLimit to 2097152</p>

<p>When doing spidering projects or other bulk catalogue management projects for osCommerce sites, I tend to finish by creating easypopulate format files so that the store owner can do any last minute edits and upload the products manually using the easypopulate system.</p>

<p>Creating easypopulate format files can be a bit of a chore, especially as every site seems to be slightly different with different columns etc.</p>

<p>For this reason, I have created a very easy to use easypopulate file creation class. You can read more about the class <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/4782.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have numerous clients who are now enjoying much, <i>much</i> easier management of their product catalogues including fully automated spidering systems that grab all details from supplier web sites and format it correctly to be uploaded to their store.</p>

<p>If you install the free version of CRELoaded, you will see that they have sneaked some Google adverts onto the bottom of your site.</p>

<p>Above the adverts will be the text</p>

<p><strong>This site is a member of the CRE Loaded Open Source Ecommerce Software community</strong></p>

<p>Bit of an underhand tactic but I suppose you have to try to make cash where you can these days&hellip;</p>

<p>I could go onto a big rant about how they are trying to make cash by simply repackaging software which was always meant to be given away freely and without hitches, including both osCommerce and the multitude of contributions they have added on there. I&rsquo;m not going to though. CRELoaded is a good product and these guys are keeping the osCommerce platform as a viable modern open source ecommerce platform.</p>

<p>Anyway &ndash; cut to the chase &ndash; to get rid of these annoying adverts all you have to do is open up</p>

<p>includes/javascript/cart_links.js.php</p>

<p>It should look like this:</p>

<p>Magento is certainly making waves. For those of you who haven&rsquo;t heard of it, Magento is looking likely to become the successor to osCommerce as the most popular open source ecommerce platform.</p>

<p>There are many things which make Magento a much better option than osCommerce. However for some people the tried and tested, &lsquo;better the devil you know&rsquo;, huge knowledge, customisation and support base of osCommerce  makes it the platform they would still prefer to put their development investment into.</p>

<p>These justifications are valid to a point, however I now believe that the time is right to move into Magento and whilst I am not certain that it is worth worrying about upgrading if you already have a perfectly functional osCommerce site, I would recommend anyone looking to set up a new ecommerce site takes a close look at Magento.</p>

<p>If you are coding a PHP script to deal with big files, it makes sense to build in some kind of caching logic so that your script won&rsquo;t download the same file every single time it is run, but will check to see how long ago it last downloaded that file and only download it again if it is more than a certain timeframe old.</p>

<p>This function allows you to do exactly that &ndash; check it out:</p>

<p>Handling directories and files with PHP is a snap. However, with this handy function you can always be sure that the destination directory path for your files will exist.</p>

<p>If you pass a path with a filename at teh end, set the second parameter to true eg make_path($path, true)</p>

<p>If you are trying to get a curl script which needs follow on location functionality to run on a server which has either open_basedir or safe mode enabled you will get an error message similar to the following:</p>

<p><strong>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION cannot be activated when in safe_mode or an open_basedir is set</strong></p>

<p>After a bit of digging, some kind soul has put a workaround <a href="http://au.php.net/manual/ro/function.curl-setopt.php#71313">here</a></p>

<p>Here is how to use the function</p>

<p>Creating regular expressions can sometimes be a frustrating experience. Generally I find using regular expressions intuitive and easy, with quick and powerful results. However every now and then you stumble into a regular expression scenario that you just can&rsquo;t seem to crack.</p>

<p>When this happens you might find yourself trying and trying different regular expressions and then echoing out the results and trying to figure out what is going wrong.</p>

<p>At times like this, a regular expression testing tool is invaluable. If like me though you don&rsquo;t really like to shell out on something that you are probably hardly ever going to use then this online <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.solmetra.lt/scripts/regex/index.php">regular expression tester</a> is great.</p>

<p>Thanks goes out to these guys for hosting such a simple but eminently useful little tool :&ndash;)</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/linux/transfer-server-permissions.html">Transfer Server Permissions</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>So sometimes you might have a restored backup without the correct permissions (whether that be because the backup didn&rsquo;t store the permissions, the file system refused to take them, or you simply forgot to add the -p flag to tar!) and you want to copy the permissions from one machine to another.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a little script to do just that that we found whilst browsing the internet to do just that (uses perl and find) :&ndash;</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>find / -type f -o -type d 2&gt;/dev/null | <span class="k">while </span><span class="nb">read </span>FILE; <span class="k">do   </span>perl -le<span class="s1">&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">    printf &quot;chmod %o \&quot;%s\&quot;\n&quot;, 07777 &amp; (stat)[2], $_</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">    for @ARGV</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">  &#39;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$FILE&quot;</span>; <span class="k">done</span> &gt; /tmp/file_perms.sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you run that on the server with the correct permissions, then transfer the file to the server with the wrong permissions and run the file with the following command, it will fix the perms on that server :&ndash;</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sh /tmp/file_perms.sh
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which may save a lot of transfer time restoring a new backup.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Smart TVs are still quite a new concept to many people. At Edmonds Commerce we believe that Smart TVs and other smart appliances will be the future. As the television is already a screen based system it is really well suited to become a web enabled and smart device. Online streaming services such as the BBC&rsquo;s iPlayer and platforms like NetFlix and LoveFilm are already well established as internet based media streaming platforms and many consumer televisions are already smart enough to consume these channels natively.</p>

<p>The real smart television revolution is going to be based around custom applications for the smart tvs, available via an app store. There is also many exciting opportunities for custom smart television applications for a wide variety of business applications including things like live information displays, connected messaging systems, warehouse management systems, live graphs and business information displays and all kinds of other ideas &ndash; the sky is the limit.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss your smart tv app idea with a specialist development agency, give Edmonds Commerce a call today!</p>

<p>A nice little extension that I just discovered takes care of this, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cbpplldpcdcfejdaldmnfhlodoadjhii" target="_blank">Chrome Form Fuzzer</a>.</p>

<p>You can configure it for simple form filling or with a little creative configuration it could easily be used for security testing and more in depth testing to ensure that input is being sanitised and filtered properly.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I recently had to generate a report listing the details of all orders from a magento store that matched certain parameters.</p>

<p>There was a requirement that the billing address should be included in this, and I wanted to do this all in SQL if possible.</p>

<p>The biggest problem was formatting the address as there is a value in the address table called suffix, which contains the County information, but is not a required value.</p>

<p>As I was adding in line breaks to the select, this meant for all of the orders that did not have the value, then there would be a blank line using a standard CONCAT statement.</p>

<p>What I found was that it is possible to add an IF statement to the CONCAT query, which gives the required result.</p>

<p>This is done like this</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>At Edmonds Commerce we were staunch Netbeans users for years but we always struggled with large scale projects (<a href="/platforms/magento/" title="Magento Platform Overview">Magento</a> I&rsquo;m looking at you) meaning that Netbeans would sometimes really crawl as it tried to reindex thousands of PHP files.</p>

<p>After a recent upgrade of our Linux desktop environment to the Mate edition of Linux Mint 13, Netbeans seemed to perform even worse and had a few bugs as well. At the same time we had been evaluating other IDE options including Eclipse and Zend Studio (which we all have free licences for thanks to being Zend Certified Developers).</p>

<p>In the end though, the one we tried that really impressed was PHPStorm. It isn&rsquo;t free open source but it isn&rsquo;t too expensive, especially considering it is perhaps the single most important and highly used tool of a professional PHP developer.</p>

<p>Now a new version has come out. Downloading and upgrading took all of 5 minutes and we are now going to enjoy better performance and some nice new features. I have yet to really test out the new version so I can&rsquo;t really report on them but they look good. You can read about all the new features in version 5 <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/whatsnew/" title="PHPStorm 5 Features" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h3>PrestaShop Summary</h3>


<p>PrestaShop is the second most popular open source shopping cart platform according to Google Trends as I write this article. Originally  founded in Paris in 2007 and with their first release in 2008, the platform has grown from strength to strength. They now have a second office in Miami USA and are pushing the platform aggressively so will no doubt grow in the future.</p>

<h3>Headline PrestaShop Features</h3>


<p>The PrestShop web site makes a big effort to emphasise the large number of features (275+ at time of writing) that are bundled with PrestaShop. Here is a highlight of some of the most interesting and important features that come with PrestaShop.</p>

<h4>Multi Channel Out of the Box</h4>


<p>Prestashop comes with Ebay Integration out of the box. This is quite unique in my experience though I do not doubt that with Magento being owned now by Ebay it won&rsquo;t be long before they have a similar out of the box solution. If you want to hook into other sales channels then there are affordable extensions available that will allow you to hook into other channels.</p>

<h4>Bulk Data Handling</h4>


<p>Prestashop ships with a fully featured bulk data import/export system that can handle products, categories, customers and more. This is a crucial feature to assist with migrations, bulk updates and possibly integrations with other systems.</p>

<h4>Core Code Overrides</h4>


<p>A bit like Magento, Prestashop features a core code override system that allows developers such as ourselves to modify the way core elements of Prestashop work without having to edit those core files. When you come to upgrade this will make things a lot easier and also makes it very clear what core functionality is being overridden which can then help enormously when reapplying those overrides to an upgraded store.</p>

<h4>SEO Features</h4>


<p>The SEO credentials of PrestaShop are really quite respectable with dedicated and customisable SEO URLs for each product and full meta information for all products and categories. PrestaShop also features both an auto generated HTML sitemap and a Google XML sitemap that Google and other search engines use to assist with fully spidering your site.</p>

<h3>Demo PrestaShop</h3>


<p>If you would like to give the PrestaShop platform a try you can access a demo version of the system both front and admin side from <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/en/demo" title="PrestaShop demo" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/opencart.html">OpenCart</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><h3>OpenCart Summary</h3>


<p>OpenCart started life as the university project of a highly skilled developer called Daniel Kerr who decided to launch the platform as an open source project. The platform was originally targeted at small to SME level businesses and the goal was to provide a platform that was easy to use an implement and yet featured modern design styles and some nice Web 2.0 style dynamic elements.</p>

<p>As the name suggest, OpenCart is entirely free open source and unlike <a href="/platforms/magento/" title="magento platform summary">Magento</a> does not have any kind of paid for premium version. The code is currently being hosted on GitHub and is free for anyone to fork, download, implement and develop upon.</p>

<h3>Headline OpenCart Features</h3>


<p>OpenCart features everything you would expect from a modern shopping cart system. In particular though here are some of the things we think are most attractive in comparison to other modern open source shopping cart platforms.</p>

<h4>Shared Hosting Friendly</h4>


<p>OpenCart will run nicely on fairly modest shared hosting. Of course if you have a high traffic or very large or demanding site then you will need beefier hosting to support this. In general though you will find OpenCart by its very nature will require less hosting resources for the same level of traffic than a more powerful but heavy system such as Magento.</p>

<h4>Simple, Slick Front End</h4>


<p>The front end of the platform features everything you would expect and thanks to tasteful use of jQuery to add interactive elements to the site has some nice modern features such as a lightbox image viewer and tabbed product information. The design is clean and clear by design with little to distract the user from the core function of browsing and purchasing products.</p>

<h4>Internationalisation</h4>


<p>Open Cart supports multiple languages, currencies, tax rates and even multiple store fronts out of the box. This means that you can easily have a fully international site with separate store fronts or simply offer a currency switcher and/or language switcher on your single store front to cater for international customers.</p>

<h4>Business to Business Functionality</h4>


<p>If you are selling to businesses and perhaps offer different pricing to consumers, businesses and larger customers then you will love the B2B features of OpenCart. You can define customer groups and assign customers to a group and then offer those customer groups different prices for the same products. For example your default price on an item for a consumer could be £9.99 however you might offer it B2B and 8.99 and have a sub set of wholesalers who you offer the item to at 6.99.</p>

<p>You can further extend this functionality by offering quantity discounts and link this up to the customer groups meaning that you could offer very good quantity discounts to your wholesale customer group and also offer some incentive to your B2C customers by offering discounts on multiples.</p>

<p>If you are focussing primarily on trade and wholesale customers, you can hide all pricing unless they are logged in. This is great for maintaining your SEO position and having your products and pages fully accessible by the public and search engines whilst maintaining confidentiality on your actual prices.</p>

<h3>Give it a Test Drive</h3>


<p>If it sounds like OpenCart might be the right solution for you then we suggest you give it a whirl. You can access the demo&rsquo;s of the front end and administration areas <a href="http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=demonstration/demonstration" title="OpenCart demo" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Netbeans has a handy feature when you right-click a file in the editor window to take you to the file in the project (file manager tab) view.</p>

<p>To get phpstorm to do this is not as simple but is handily mappable to a shortcut key.</p>

<p>To enable this, go to Settings->Keymap->Main menu->Navigate->Select in&hellip; and choose a key.  I set it to Alt+P, so now I press Alt+P then press enter to go to the current file in the project view.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Having a stack trace is very handy at times but wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you could click on the filename in the stack trace in your browser and your IDE take you to the file and line that it&rsquo;s talking about?</p>

<p>Well, with PhpStorm and kint, you can!  Using a plugin called Remote Call, the PhpStorm IDE can listen on a port and go to files and line numbers via an ajax call.</p>

<p>To configure this, grab the latest version of kint, and copy it&rsquo;s sample config to an actual config file, and edit the section about pathDisplayCallback to look like this :&ndash;</p>

<p>Now, if you call Kint::trace(); from your file that you&rsquo;ve included Kint.class.php from, you get a clickable stacktrace!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>I have had continual problems getting most of my USB keys to work as liveusb drives.</p>

<p>This is pretty awkward however it looks like I have now found a solution that works. Instead of using the official Fedora live USB creator, we are going to use something called livecd-iso-to-disk</p>

<p>First of all install it:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo yum -y install livecd-tools
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then this is your command to create the liveusb. Note you need to set the sdX to whichever your USB key is using, and of course make sure the path to the iso file is correct</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><figcaption class='panel-heading'><h3 class='panel-title'></h3></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>sudo livecd-iso-to-disk --format --msdos --reset-mbr --overlay-size-mb 512 --home-size-mb 512 ~/Downloads/Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso /dev/sdc
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that&rsquo;s it</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>You might not be aware that in Gnome Shell and likely anything else using Linux you can easily block sound from entire applications.</p>

<p>For me this means blocking annoying auto playing videos with sound that are cropping up as I&rsquo;m trying to listen to some nice tunes whilst I work.</p>

<p>To block the sound is very easy, simply go to the sound control panel which in Gnome Shell is access via the top right panel.</p>

<p>Once into the sound section, go to the right most tab where you can control sounds on an application by application basis. Simply turn off the annoying onces.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Came across an interesting Github project today &ndash; a command line text editor that is designed to look and feel and largely behave like a GUI text editor such as Sublime.</p>

<p>Meet <a href="https://github.com/slap-editor/slap">Slap</a></p>

<p>Installation is trivial assuming you already have node installed:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm -g install slap</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once its installed you can open any file as you would with any other cli text editor</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>slap my-file.php</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Immediate impressions are quite positive. A familiar feeling file browser in the left column is coupled with a text editing pane on the right that responds well to mouse clicks and familiar key presses.
The text highlighting is very nice and things like brace matching are also included.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me it seems that mouse usage often lead to garbage characters being inserted into the text which render it unusable for the moment though this could be an issue specific to my machine.</p>

<p>Definitely a project to keep an eye on though if you like trying new CLI text editors. That said I&rsquo;m writing this post in SPF13 Vim which I&rsquo;m pretty happy with :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p><img src="/assets/gpsbabel-initial.png"></p>

<p>GPSBabel was created to enable conversion between the multitude of location file formats, such as GPX and KML, as well as the many formats used by different GPS devices.</p>

<p>Its strength lies in the way it imports data from the source in a format-agnostic way which allows it to make changes to the data using Filters. Notable filters include the ability to use only records from a specific time range, within a specific radius of a specified point, minimise the amount of points in a track and generate tracks from waypoints.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/gpsbabel-filters.png"></p>

<p>Other options include the abaility to automnatically generate names, labelled &ldquo;Synthesize short names&rdquo;, in case your export gives long names as Backitude does.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s available as a CLI application for Windows, Mac and Linux, with each featuring a GUI for easier discovery of its features. It handily displays the command paramters built up in the GUI for easier automating.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>One of the trickiest parts of any e-commerce store to get running quickly is the search results. The problem is compounded for large or complex stores where a database query based search for a multi word search phrase can become a real behemoth of a database query that has to search for each word in a multitude of database tables and columns. Then throw in other issues such as table locking and the performance issues can start to hurt the site as a whole.</p>

<h3>Caching for Performance</h3>

<p>One common solution to scaling up e-commerce stores is to use a variety of methods and levels of caching, from a database query cache right up to a full page caching system perhaps powered by Varnish. This solution works well for product and category pages for which there is a finite number. When it comes to search results pages though, each possible search phrase is a completely separate set of pages. You might be able to keep a warm cache for your most popular search phrases but anything else will be raw results. It will show your server at its worst performance.</p>

<h3>Alternative Enterprise Search Engine</h3>

<p>In this scenario it is time to start looking at other search solutions. If you want a turnkey professional solution then check out Google Commerce Search. This premium offering gives you a powerful search engine that is entirely outsourced and uses Google technology to deliver great quality results. As you can probably imagine though, this premium product comes with a premium and enduringly high subscription fee.</p>

<h3>Enterprise Open Source</h3>

<p>Instead what we are now recommending to our larger clients is to look at implementing the Solr search engine. Apache Solr is an enterprise level search engine. It is used in a wide variety of impressive sites – you can see a list here. Names like Netflix, The Guardian and eBay really underline the fact that this is serious and powerful technology.</p>

<h3>Advanced Search Functionality</h3>

<p>The great thing is that it is also pretty easy to set up and get running. To get a basic search engine working is no more than a few hours of work. There are many possibilities with the search engine including spelling suggestions, parametric (faceted in Solr speak) search, synoyms, auto suggest and loads more. Depending on exactly how you want this to work will determine exactly how much work is involved.</p>

<p>Solr provides a huge amount of configurability and tuning. For this reason we would always expect a new install of Solr to be followed up with a bit of tweaking to make sure you are getting the right results. Once the right configuration has been determined we can then expect the engine to work tirelessly, serving up lightning fast and excellent quality results without any further investment from your business.</p>

<h2>Implement Solr Search Today</h2>

<p>If you would like your site to be fitted out with a Solr based search system by a professional UK based e-commerce web development agency then get in touch with <a href="http://www.edmondscommerce.co.uk/contact">Edmonds Commerce</a> today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>As someone who types a lot of text everyday and am generally quite keen not to lose my work, I tend to hit the key combination [Ctrl]+[S] quite a lot.
In fact its almost become muscle memory that every sentence or two I will hit that combination.</p>

<p>When working on a terminal, this can have the unfortunate outcome that the terminal freezes up. For more time than I would like to admit, I thought that this was a Linux bug
And found myself frequently restarting terminal sessions that had locked up.</p>

<p>Then I discovered that you can unlock this when it freezes by hitting [Ctrl]+[Q]. However this is a bit of a pain.</p>

<p>I have now discovered a way of turning off this behaviour completely which is a real relief. Simply add the following to your .bashrc file:</p>

<figure class='code panel panel-default'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#Prevent Ctrl+S Freezing Terminal
</span><span class='line'>stty -ixon</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Load testing is something that you really need a decent solution for. A simple tool such as Apache Bench (ab) is overly simplistic for todays web applications.</p>

<p>After some research I decided to use Apache Jmeter as the tool of choice. It is written in Java so easy enough to run on any platform.
It features a GUI which is ideal for creating your tests, then a command line version which is what you should use to run your tests.</p>

<p>For my purposes I wanted to feed in a large list of URLs, for that I followed these instructions:
<a href="http://asciiville.com/musings/coder/how-to-feed-jmeter-from-csv">http://asciiville.com/musings/coder/how-to-feed-jmeter-from-csv</a></p>

<p>This allows you to create a csv file with your choice of URLs. It was actually quite hard to find a decent and succint guide to getting this set up but thankfully that page fitted my requirements.</p>

<p>Once I started to run the test I quickly realised that my system was grinding to a halt with out of memory errors. A bit more searching yielded this page which advises on how to properly run Jmeter including the fact that you really should run it on the command line for proper testing.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Some times you just need something simple to manage database versions. This few lines of PHP is something I have used on various projects to assist with database versioning.</p>

<p>It is definitely not a fully featured migrations system, there is no downgrade functionality, it is purely for versioning up a DB to the latest version.</p>

<p>Largely how it works is up to you as it is simply a way of requiring PHP files in numerical order.</p>

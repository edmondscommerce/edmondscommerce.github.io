    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lot of concern has been caused by the &ldquo;Cookie Law&rdquo; which says you must tell people that you use cookies if you do, and 99% of sites do!</p>

<p>Well here&rsquo;s a very simple jQuery bolt-on that deals with that, and although visitors need javascript enabled to see it, you have made &ldquo;best efforts&rdquo; to inform them, and on any eCommerce site you&rsquo;re going to have a &ldquo;this site requires javascript message&rdquo; anyway.</p>

<p>The file to download is from github (isn&rsquo;t opensource great?) <a href="https://github.com/carlwoodhouse/jquery.cookieBar" title="jQuery.cookiebar on github">here</a> and is as simple to implement as add the script file to the head and somewhere on the page insert the following :
```javascript</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function() {
      $.cookieBar();
    });
</script>


<p>```</p>

<p>The example page is also on github : <a href="http://carlwoodhouse.github.com/jquery.cookieBar/" title="CookieBar example page"><a href="http://carlwoodhouse.github.com/jquery.cookieBar/">http://carlwoodhouse.github.com/jquery.cookieBar/</a></a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If your Magento store is occasionally throwing up redirect loop errors in your web browser this might be your problem, and your solution.</p>

<p>It seems that Magento doesn&rsquo;t properly support British Summer Time as standard, so if you are using GMT then your times might be an hour out. That&rsquo;s not ideal but its not the end of the world. The problem arises in that the cookie lifespan is set to 1 hour by default. That means that as soon as a session cookie is set, it is expired and this can then send your browser into a redirect loop as cookies are set and expired successively.</p>

<p>The quick fix is simply to increase the cookie lifespan to something over 1 hour.</p>

<p>Another possible fix is detailed in this thread:
